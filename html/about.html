    <p class="title">About Me</p>
    <p class="info">I am a front-end web developer, a project manager, and a lover of minimalism.
    <p class="info">I have a passion for clean lines, organized folders, and an efficient team. At any given time, you will find me developing apps for myself, designing business materials for non profits, or writing business requirements at a large finance company.</p> 
    <p class="info">Off-screen, I'm a cat Mom, amateur vegetarian home "chef", and lover of the outdoors. Few things make me happier than when I find the puzzle piece that solves a problem or I find a brussel sprouts appetizer on a menu.</p>
